    <p> Cat Island in Japan is famous for its large population of cats, which were originally brought to the island to control rodent populations. The cats have multiplied and now roam freely.</p>

        <p>Visitors to Cat Island must take a ferry from Nagahama, and the ride offers scenic views of the surrounding Pacific Ocean. The island
           is a popular tourist destination, but it is important to respect the island's rules and not interfere with the cats.</p>

        <p> Cat Island is home to over 100 cats, outnumbering the human population. The cats are semi-feral but are often friendly and can be
           played with and fed in designated areas. However, there are no shops or restaurants on the island, making it essential for visitors
           to bring their own supplies.</p>

            <p>One way to come see Cat Island is by starting in Nagahama, which is what many do. The ferry to Cat Island starts here anyway,
               so it could be nice to check out that quaint city before venturing off to pet the kitties!</p>
